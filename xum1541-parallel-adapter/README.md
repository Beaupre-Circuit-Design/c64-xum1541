# XUM1541 Parallel Adapter

# Introduction

A SpeedDos compatible interface for the 1541 disk drive to enable parallel communication.

# Components and assembly

Component selection isn't terribly critical, whathever you have in hand that fit the values will probably work just fine. Values for the led resistors will drive them at around 18ma which may be quite bright, increase the values if it's the case.

As alway, when assembling, start with the smallest components and grow in size as you go.
